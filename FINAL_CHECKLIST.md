## üöÄ Pre-Demo Setup

### Day Before Hackathon
- [ ] Test on your machine
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python test_analyzer.py
  ```
- [ ] Install all dependencies
  ```bash
  # Backend
  cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Frontend
  cd frontend && npm install
  ```
- [ ] Verify API key is set in `backend/.env`
- [ ] Run full test with a small repo
- [ ] Pick 2-3 demo repositories
- [ ] Pre-analyze demo repos and take screenshots
- [ ] Prepare backup video/screenshots
- [ ] Practice your pitch (2-3 times)

### Morning of Demo
- [ ] Charge laptop fully
- [ ] Test internet connection
- [ ] Close all unnecessary applications
- [ ] Test both backend and frontend start up
- [ ] Have demo repo URLs ready to copy-paste
- [ ] Zoom browser to 125-150% for visibility
- [ ] Test with judges' network (if possible)

## üéØ Demo Flow Reminder

### 1. The Hook (30 seconds)
"Have you ever inherited a codebase and wondered what secrets are hiding inside?"

### 2. The Problem (30 seconds)
- Dead code cluttering repos
- Forgotten TODOs
- No fun way to explore code history

### 3. The Solution (30 seconds)
"Code Archaeology Explorer turns boring code analysis into an interactive museum!"

### 4. Live Demo (4-5 minutes)
1. Enter repo URL
2. Show excavation loading
3. Walk through Summary
4. Show 3-4 favorite exhibits
5. Read AI stories aloud!

### 5. Tech Stack (1 minute)
- Python + Flask + GitPython
- Claude AI for storytelling
- React + Vite for UI

### 6. Use Cases (30 seconds)
- Onboarding
- Technical debt tracking
- Making code reviews fun

### 7. Close (30 seconds)
"Makes code analysis engaging and actionable!"

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment (if using one)
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check API key
cat .env
```

### Frontend Won't Start
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Analysis Fails
- Use absolute paths for local repos
- Verify repo has git history
- Try a smaller repo first
- Check API key is valid

### CORS Errors
- Make sure backend is running on port 5000
- Check Flask-CORS is installed

## üì± Backup Plans

### If Live Demo Fails
1. **Screenshots ready** - Pre-analyzed repos
2. **Video recording** - Full demo walkthrough
3. **Verbal explanation** - You know how it works!

### If Internet Fails
- Use local repository path instead of GitHub URL
- Demo on your own project folder

### If Claude API Fails
- Show the artifacts without stories
- Explain what the AI would generate
- Reference your screenshots with stories

## üéì Key Talking Points

### Technical Achievement
- Full-stack application
- Git history parsing
- Static code analysis
- AI integration
- Clean, polished UI

### Innovation
- Museum metaphor is novel
- AI storytelling makes it unique
- Combines utility with entertainment

### Practical Value
- Real problem (technical debt)
- Real solution (automated detection)
- Real use cases (onboarding, reviews)

### Claude Integration
- Perfect for Claude Builder Club
- Showcases Claude's creative writing
- Novel use of AI beyond chatbots

## üìä Demo Repositories Suggestions

### Great Demo Repos:
1. **Your own projects** - You can explain context
2. **Old hackathon projects** - Usually have many artifacts
3. **Medium open-source repos** - Recognizable names

### Example GitHub Repos to Try:
- Small Flask projects
- Old tutorial repos
- Your school assignments
- Early versions of popular tools

### What Makes a Good Demo Repo:
‚úÖ Has git history (100+ commits)
‚úÖ Medium size (not too big)
‚úÖ Has some TODOs/dead code
‚úÖ You can explain it
‚ùå Too clean (boring results)
‚ùå Too large (slow analysis)
‚ùå Private (can't access publicly)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management

### 5-Minute Slot:
- Pitch: 1min
- Demo: 3min
- Wrap: 1min

### 10-Minute Slot:
- Pitch: 2min
- Demo: 5min
- Tech: 2min
- Wrap: 1min

### Q&A Prep:
Common questions:
- "How does dead code detection work?"
- "What languages does it support?"
- "How long does analysis take?"
- "Could this integrate with CI/CD?"
- "What about private repos?"

(See DEMO_GUIDE.md for answers!)

## üéâ After Your Demo

### If It Goes Well:
- [ ] Get contact info of interested people
- [ ] Note feedback for improvements
- [ ] Take photos of your presentation
- [ ] Celebrate! üéä

### If It Goes Poorly:
- [ ] Learn from what went wrong
- [ ] You built a full application!
- [ ] Great experience regardless
- [ ] Still celebrate! üéä
